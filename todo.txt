[1] DRY the favorite view (network/rating) code is very similar and repetitive.
[2] DRY the dashboard JS code
[3] Find a more efficient way to make/populate/run the dashboard
[4] Add creation of PDFs to download in the Drama list page
[5] Create a variable inside a function using a string passed to the same function, ex:

function("testvariable") {
    testvariable = 5;
}

this is for creating both rating histogram charts using the same function.
[6] Solve the dashboard.js problem without "setTimeout()"
[7] Add comments to the dramas
[8] Allow drama modification from the dramalist.html page
